# NKSS: PL/SQL Simple Scheduler
### Run concurrent programs with an arbitrary number of workers

Although tools like Apache JMeter is very good to simulate high concurrency,  
I always prefer run my tests and production batch parallel processing directly from the database.

This very simple API can be used for any type of processing and workloads within the database.
